1. Name would be the Name of the object on SF.
2. allowed-fields will be the list of SF fields which are allowed 
that particular object. 
3. Mapping would help in figuring out which JSON key would go in which SF field. 
4. Give a name to every mapping so that we can give this to other product teams for keeping the correct mapping.


Challenges: 
1. How to store linked object. 
2. How to type cast data in case the data type changes in json. 
3. How flat can we keep the structures of input as well as output json.
4. Validation
5. Making a random test call to validate the schema.
